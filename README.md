# Carbon Credit Marketplace

A decentralized carbon credit marketplace built on Sui blockchain, featuring micro-projects, dMRV verification, and transparent trading of carbon credits.

## 🌱 Overview

This project implements a complete carbon credit marketplace that enables:

- **Project Creation**: Developers can create micro-projects for carbon sequestration
- **Credit Minting**: Verified carbon credits are minted as NFTs on Sui
- **dMRV Verification**: Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification system
- **Marketplace Trading**: Transparent buying and selling of carbon credits
- **Project Funding**: Direct funding of carbon projects by corporate buyers
- **Credit Retirement**: Permanent retirement of credits to prevent double-spending

## 🏗️ Architecture
