# Decentralized Carbon Credit Marketplace for Micro-Projects

A strategic implementation of a decentralized carbon credit marketplace leveraging Sui's object model for on-chain verification of micro-projects.

## 🎯 Vision

Transform the carbon credit market by enabling small-scale, local environmental projects to access funding and credibly verify their impact through blockchain technology. Our platform focuses on micro-projects that are traditionally excluded from conventional carbon markets due to high verification costs and technical barriers.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Micro-Project Focus**: Streamlined onboarding for smallholder farmers, Indigenous communities, and local environmental initiatives
- **On-Chain Verification**: Leveraging Sui's object model for granular, verifiable carbon credit representation
- **Digital MRV**: Real-time data collection through sensors, satellite imagery, and community reports
- **Direct Funding**: Eliminating intermediaries to ensure fair benefit distribution
- **Corporate Integration**: Seamless API access for corporate buyers seeking verifiable impact
- **USDC Payments**: Stable, regulatory-compliant payment processing
