# Carbon Credit Marketplace

A decentralized carbon credit marketplace built on Sui blockchain, featuring micro-projects, dMRV verification, and transparent trading of carbon credits.

## üå± Overview

This project implements a complete carbon credit marketplace that enables:

- **Project Creation**: Developers can create micro-projects for carbon sequestration
- **Credit Minting**: Verified carbon credits are minted as NFTs on Sui
- **dMRV Verification**: Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification system
- **Marketplace Trading**: Transparent buying and selling of carbon credits
- **Project Funding**: Direct funding of carbon projects by corporate buyers
- **Credit Retirement**: Permanent retirement of credits to prevent double-spending

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Credit System**: Mint, verify, trade, and retire carbon credits
- **Capability-based Access Control**: Developer and verifier capabilities
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration**: Sui wallet connection via @mysten/dapp-kit
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Complete hook system for blockchain interaction
